# angular-the-complete-guide-2023

This repository contains the code written during my tiem studying Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [Angular - The Complete Guide 2023] on Udemy.

This course is the most comprehensive and best-selling Angular course on Udemy.  From Setup to Deployment, this course covers it all.  I learned all about Components, Directives, Services, Forms, HTTP Access, Authentication, Optimizing an Angular App with Modules and Offline Compilation, the Angular CLI, and much more.

This course taught me the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access, and much more.  Every topic consisted of a lecture, coding exercise, and application to the capstone project.  Specifically, I learned:

* Which architecture Angular uses.
* How to use Typescript to write Angular applications.
* All about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives and components.
* How databinding works.
* All about routing and handling navigation.
* What pipes are and how to use them.
* How to access the Web (e.g. RESTful servers).
* What dependency injection is and how to use it.
* How to use Modules in Angular.
* How to optimize my (bigger) Angular Application.
* An introduction to NgRx and complex state management.

Feel free to look around if you need a quick refresher on any topic.  I feel like I may periodically snoop back here myself.
